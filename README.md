# Conclusion

Keep it simple. No need to overengineering with BLoC.

Note: If you find generic hard to understand.

I agree, it's overkill for `ContentWithoutStateView`.

Check this commit for the [non-generic version](https://github.com/jasonrichdarmawan/swift-bloc-example/tree/85dc68e012c7853a899b5a524505d4103dc404fc)

So, when it is not an overkill?

Let say there is 3 views that need `ContentWithoutStateView`:
1. `RegulationView`
2. `RegulationContentView`
3. `DefinitionView`

Let say the responsibility of `ContentWithoutStateView` is to render list of bookmark and save bookmark from the 3 views. Each has it own parameters.

To solve this, we need dependency injection and generic is the prerequisite.

It's not the responsibility of `ContentWithoutStateView' to save what kind of bookmark.

Still think this as overkill?

Yes, it is but by using dependency injection, we can create a unit tests for the ViewModel.

# Engineering Principles

1. 1 thing in 1 file

2. use `struct` to define required parameters.

   the benefit: 
   1. single source of truth for required parameter.

   for example, `ContentWithoutStateViewModelParams` is used by:
   1. `ContentWithoutStateViewModel.init(params:)`
   2. `ContentWithoutStateViewModel.shared(params:)`

3. never inject a ViewModel to a constructor. 

   use the parameters, then initialize the ViewModel inside the constructor.

   if we pass ViewModel to a constructor, it will lead to unexpected behavior such as:
   1. if we pass a ViewModel to a Sheet View, the ViewModel will not deinit when the sheet is dismissed.
   2. if we pass a ViewModel to a non Sheet View, the ViewModel will deinit. ConcerningðŸ˜‚

4. 1 component for 1 thing

   the benefit:
   1. easy to read View file.
   2. (bonus) maybe, reusable component.

# Advantage of BLoC

- Change 2 state but only rerender once.

# Disadvantage of BLoC

- Can't pass Binding to a View
